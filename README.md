# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit

## Domain
Social Media

## Problem Statement
Create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The app should enable users to input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve relevant data using the Google API. Users can store data in MongoDB as a data lake, collect data for up to 10 YouTube channels, and migrate it to a SQL database. Querying the data warehouse with SQL and displaying the data in the Streamlit app.

### Technologies Used
- Python scripting
- API integration
- Data collection
- MongoDB (Atlas)
- Streamlit
- postgreSQL
  
## Approach
1. Set up a Streamlit app for a user-friendly interface.
2. Connect to the YouTube API to retrieve channel and video data.
3. Store data in MongoDB for flexibility with unstructured data.
4. Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse for structured querying.
5. Display retrieved data with Streamlit's data visualization features.
